                            <br> I am a data scientist. I believe that <strong> words and data are the two most powerful tools to change the world. </strong>
                            <br><br>
                            Most of my time is spent staring at a computer screen. During the day, I am usually programming, working to derive insight from large datasets. My skills include <strong>data analysis, visualization,Deep earning and machine learning.</strong>
                            I often work on end-to-end data science projects that usually begin from collecting data from third party sources and end with delivering business insight in the form of customer segments.

                            At night, I take some time off to work on things I'm passionate about.

                            You can take a look at some of my projects and articles in the section below. I will link my work to their GitHub repositories, so feel free to download my code and play around with it.
                            Most of my education has come from online platforms.
                            I have downloaded e-books, audited courses on edX and Coursera, and spent countless hours on sites like HackerRank and FreeCodeCamp. I am grateful to online educators who have given me the opportunity to learn these things, and for democratizing education.
                            <br><br>
                            I create starter code for data science and visualization projects and publish it for everyone to read.
